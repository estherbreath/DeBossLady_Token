# DeBossLady_Token Overview

### Purpose
The MyToken contract is an implementation of the ERC-20 token
standard on the Ethereum blockchain.
It represents a fungible digital asset with the ability
to be transferred, minted (created), and burned (destroyed).

### Features:

- Minting: The contract includes a mint function, allowing the contract owner (address with ownership privileges) to create and distribute new tokens to specified addresses.

- Burning: The contract includes a burn function, enabling any token holder to destroy a certain amount of their own tokens, reducing the total supply.

- Transferring: The contract includes a transfer function, overriding the ERC-20 standard method, which allows any token holder to transfer tokens to another address.

### Interaction
This contract is deployed on Remix. 
There you can mint token, burn token, and transfer token as well.
